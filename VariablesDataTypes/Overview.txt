Overview
- 1. Remember that a program needs to store the instructions of its program and the data that it acts upon while your computer is executing that program

  = 1. This information is stored in memory (RAM)
  = 2. RAM's contents are lost when the computer is turned off
  = 3. Hard drives store persistent data

- 2. You can think of RAM as ordered sequence of boxes
  = 1. The box is full when it represents 1 or the box it empty when it represents 0
  = 2. Each box represents one binary digit, either 0 or 1 (true and false)
  = 3. Each box is called a bit

- 3. Bits in memory are grouped into sets of eight (byte)
  = 1. Each byte has been labeled with a number (address)
  = 2. The address of a byte uniquely references that byte in your computer's memory

- 4. Again, memory consists of a large number of bits that are in groups of eight (called bytes) and each byte has a unique address

  = Your program will access that data usually through an identifer, but it can also use hexadecimal addresses

Variables
- 1. The true power of programs you create is their manipulation of data
  = So, we need to understand the different data types you can use, as well as how to create and name variables

- 2. Constants are types of data that do not change and retain their values throughout the life of the program

- 3. Variables are types of data may change or be assigned values as the program runs
- 4. Variables are the names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program
