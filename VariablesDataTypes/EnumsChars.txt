Enums (cont'd)
- 1. To declare a variable to be of type enum primaryColor
  = 1. Use the keyword enum
  = 2. Followed by the enumerated type name
  = 3. Followed by the variable list. So the statement

- 2. enum primaryColor, myColor, gregsColor;
- 3. Defines the two variables myColor and gregsColor to be of type primaryColor
  = 1. The only permissible values that can be assigned to these variables are the names red, yellow, and blue
  = 2. myColor = red;

- 4. Another example
  = enum month {January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December};

Enums as ints
- 1. The compiler actually treats enumeration indentifiers as integer constants
  = First name in list is 0

enum month thisMonth;
thisMonth = February;

- 2. The value 1 is assigned to thisMonth (and not the name February) because it is the second identifier listed inside the enumeration list

- 3. If you want to have a specific integer value associated with an enumeration identifier, the integer can be assigned to the identifer when the data type is defined
