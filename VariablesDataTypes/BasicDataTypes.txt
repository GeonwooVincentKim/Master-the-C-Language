Overview
- 1. We understand that C supports many different types of variables and each type of variable is used for storing kind of data

  = 1. Types that store integers
  = 2. Types that store nonintegral numerical values
  = 3. Types that store characters

- 2. Some examples of basic data types in C are:
  = 1. int
  = 2. float
  = 3. double
  = 4. char
  = 5. _Bool

- 3. The difference between the types is in the amount of memory they occupy and the range of values they can hold

  = 1. The amount of storage that is allocated to store a particular type of data
  = 2. Depends on the computer you are running (machine-dependent)
  = 3. An integer might take up 32 bits on your computer or perhaps it might be stored in 64

Int
- 1. A variable of type int can be used to contain integral values only (values that do not contain decimal places)

- 2. A minus sign preceding the data type and variable indicates that the value is negative
- 3. The int type is a signed integer
  = It must be an integer and it can be positive, negative, or zero

- 4. If an integer is preceded by a zero and the letter x (either lowercase or uppercase), the value is taken as being expressed in hexadecimal (base 16) notation

  = int rgbColor = 0xFFEF0D;

- 5. The values 158, -10, and 0 are all valid examples of integer constants
  = 1. No embedded spaces are permitted between the digits
  = 2. Values larger than 999 cannot be expressed using commas (12,000 must be written as 12000)

Float
- 1. A variable to be of type float can be used for storing floating-point numbers (values containing decimal places)

- 2. The values 3., 125.8, and -.0001 are all valid examples of floating-point constants that can be assigned to a variable

- 3. Floating-point constants can also be expressed in scientific notation
  = 1.7e4 is a floating-point value expressed in this notation and represents the value 1.7 x 10 to the power of 4
