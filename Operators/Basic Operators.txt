Assignment Operators (cont'd)
- 1. /= 
  -> 1. Divide AND assignment operator. It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand

  -> 2. C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A

- 2. /= 
  -> 1. Modules AND assignment operaotr. It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand
  -> 2. C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A

- 3. <<= 
  -> 1. Left shift AND assignment operator
  -> 2. C <<= 2 is same as C = C << 2

- 4. >>= 
  -> 1. Right shift AND assignment operator
  -> 2. C >>= 2 is same as C = C >> 2

- 5. &= 
  -> 1. Bitwise AND assignment operator
  -> 2. C &= 2 is same as C = C & 2
  
- 6. ^= 
  -> 1. Bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator
  -> 2. C ^= is same as C = C ^ 2

- 7. |= 
  -> 1. Bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator
  -> 2. C |= 2 is same as C = C | 2
