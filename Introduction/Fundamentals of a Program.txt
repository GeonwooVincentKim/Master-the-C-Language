I. Higher Level Programming Languages
1. Compilers
- 1. A program that translates the high-level language source code into the detaeiled set of machine language instructions the computer requires
  
  = Compilation
    -> 1. Convert Source code (Written in C Language) to the Machine Code (in CS)
    -> 2. Convert Korean to the English (in Human Language)

- 2. The program does the high-level thinking and the compiler generates the tedious instructions to the cpu

2. Compilers will also check that your program has valid syntax for the programming language that you are compiling

- Finds errors and it reports them to you and doesn't produce an executable until you fix them

3. High-level languages are easier to learn and much easier to program in than are machine languages

II. Writing a program
1. Define the program objectives
- 1. Understand the requirements of the program
- 2. Get a clear idea of what you want the program to accomplish

2. Design the program
- 1. Decide how to program will meet the above requirements
- 2. What should the user interface be like?
- 3. How should the program be organized?

3. Write the code
- 1. Start implementation, translate the design in the syntax of C
- 2. You need to use a text editor to create what is called a source code file

4. Compile
5. Run the program
6. Test and debug the program
7. Maintain and modify the program
