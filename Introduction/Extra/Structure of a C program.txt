Case sensitive
- 1. Uppercase `Int` in C is not going to compile
- 2. Uppercase and lowercase are distinct
- 3. It doesn't matter where you start typing your line
  = 1. Can type it at the beginning
  = 2. Can put everything on the same line if you want some of it

- 4. Syntax detail = All the statements are ending in a semicolon

Functions
- 1. Main function may call other functions
- 2. main - main routine and then the semicolons that end
- 3. int (Integer) main and return the function
  = Depends the type of main, it could be `void` and don't have to return it

- 4. Sometimes in the main you'll see this keyword named void - int main(void)
  = means that the main program doesn't accept any parameters or any data
  = void - no data, empty parentheses now because the main is a keyword

Readable code
- 1. Adding new lines and add indentation after each line of code, it makes it easier to read
- 2. Can easily identify that lines are inside of a block of code
  = It has brackets
